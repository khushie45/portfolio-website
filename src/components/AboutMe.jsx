      <p className='about--info'>Hello World!! I'm a Computer Science student, absolutely captivated by web development, especially the fantastic realm of ReactJS. My passion revolves around taking those snazzy design concepts and turning them into actual functional websites. When I'm not diving into lines of code, you'll likely catch me reading books or sleeping. </p>

      <p className='about--info'>This portfolio? Think of it as a scrapbook documenting my journey through the web development landscape. From quirky personal projects to my spotify playlist, it's all here. So take a little tour, explore around, and if you share the same enthusiasm for all things web, let's have a chat!</p>
